This version was my attempt to create a web server with motion detction, building on guides from Last Minute Engineers to create the web
server and Eloquint Arduino's library for motion detection. 

Modified to use WPA2 Wifi authentication as testing was done on Carleton's 
wireless network.

The idea was to comapare frames to detect movemment and then automatically trigger the "Save Still" function of the
website when detected.

Couldn't get it working after trying for several weeks, the motion detection starts and works but stops working when 
the web server starts live streaming, essentially making it just an ineffeicent motion detector, which at that point a user would be 
better off using an actual PIR motion sensor.
